# Restaurant-Management-System
Brief Idea: This project would hold various concepts, such as ratings, graphs, colour changing effects and many more to hopefully aid restaurants with booking tables and create a more streamlined experience for customers. This could be very useful for small restaurants. It will be an online booking system that will be managed by the restaurant manager or admin. Click to view the project by clicking on ‘GO TO THE PROJECT’. Credentials are given below. An admin could add an extra menu and we can give it to the owner. The root can only book the table and change the table accordingly. Challenges: Everything went smoothly, the only mild difficulty was changing the colours to differentiate between a free table and a booked table. There would also be individual colour codes to indicate if the food order is being processed and if the bill has been paid. After the customer has left, the table will indicate it is empty and ready for a new patron. This System was mainly developed for small restaurants. The features are described here: Most Popular Dish by Sale (pie chart), Best Dish by Rating (bar chart), Split Bill, Print Bill, Manage Restaurant Tables, Provide Ratings, Advanced Table Booking, Different User Access with different permission.
